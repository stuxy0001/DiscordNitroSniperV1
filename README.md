## Tips

- Try to get a low latency to Discord servers as there often is competition with other snipers.
- This is technically a self-bot: mentioning this in a Discord chat is enough to make your account reportable to Trust & Safety.
- Running more than one instance or different snipers is an easy way to get your account deactivated or terminated.
- Before using, consider the moral implications of stealing gifts from people and communities you have nothing to do with.
